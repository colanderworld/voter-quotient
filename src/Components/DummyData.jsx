In April 2019, he unveiled realopioidpain.com. The website creates a new way for Missourians to share their stories and experiences with this epidemic. Eric is also partnering with agencies to combat the epidemic.  Also under his leadership, Missouri joined a lawsuit against 20 of the largest drug manufacturers in the nation for inflating and manipulating generic drug prices in one of the most damaging and far-reaching price fixing schemes in modern American history. By engaging in this lawsuit, Eric is sending a clear message to pharmaceutical companies: if you harm any of the 6 million people that call Missouri home and artificially manipulate drug prices, we will hold you accountable."
